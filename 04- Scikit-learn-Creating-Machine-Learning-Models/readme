## This "Scikit-Learn-Creating-Machine-Learning-Models" folder is about learning essential concepts and step-by-step process of creating Machine Learning Model using Scikit-Learn library and Python Programming.[https://scikit-learn.org/stable/]
###Notebooks:
- Learn and practice about introductory and basic concepts of creating machine learning with sklearn library [introduction-to-scikit-learn.ipynb]
- Learn and practice about detail workflow and concepts[typical-scikit-learn-workflow.ipynb]: 
      1. getting data (including car-sales data, heart-disease data, boston-house-dataset)
      2. choosing the right estimator/algorithm for our problem (including RandomForestClassifier and RandomForestRegressor) 
      3. fit the model/algorithm and use it to make prediction in our data
      4. evaluating a model (evaluation methods)
      5. improve a model(tuning methods: manually, RandomizedSearchCV, GridSearchCV)
      6. Save and Load a trained model
- Putting and implementing step-by-step workflow together[putting_all_together_ML_workflow.ipynb]
